## TinyMCE
TinyMCE generates output in HTML5 and supports the integration of elements such as lists, tables, and more. Although it provides robust editing capabilities, it includes a watermark similar to the React Jodit editor. For comprehensive documentation and further details, please refer to the [TinyMCE Docs](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/).

## React Quill
React Quill effectively addresses the watermark limitations found in other editors and offers the additional benefit of returning HTML code for the content entered, making it ideal for scenarios where further processing or customization is required. For more information on its advantages and design philosophy, see the [Why Quill?](https://quilljs.com/docs/why-quill) page.
